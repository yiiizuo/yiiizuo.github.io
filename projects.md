## CareNurse in SenseTime
<img src="/images/SenseNurse.png">
<img src="/images/SenseNurse_1.png">

The intelligent nursing system is a nursing product designed for disabled patients such as inability to speak or move their limbs. It provides non-contact care and monitoring of patients, measures their physiological indicators in real-time, and gives an alarm in certain situations. It also implements the function of remote patient care.
The intelligent nursing system is composed of CareNurse software, SenseHealth display software, multiple alarms, and a vertical bracket.

Main functions:<br>
(1) Physiological indicators detection: non-contact real-time detection of the patient's heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature.<br>
(2) Abnormality detection: When the caregiver experiences breathing difficulties or other conditions, it will automatically alarm.<br>
(3) Actively calling for help: The caregiver can actively issue an alarm through facial expressions.<br>
(4) Remote monitoring: It is possible to remotely view the physiological indicators of the caregiver in real-time through the Pad.<br>

### My job responsibilities:<br>
(1) Project team startup members: Build the entire project architecture from scratch. <br>
(2) Responsible for the construction of the CareNurse system, including but not limited to embedding anomaly detection algorithms, physiological indicator detection algorithms (respiratory rate, heart rate, body temperature), JAVA development, and deployment of facial recognition algorithms.<br>
(3) Connect with customers. Customize functions according to customer needs.<br>
(4) Collection of relevant data. This includes setting up an environment for data collection, defining label collection standards, and cleaning the dataset.<br>
(5) Video production for product demonstrations.<br>
(6) Maintenance and Upgrade of Product Code.<br>

## Eye-controlled Intelligent Wheelchair
<img src="/images/Eye-Wheelchair.png">
This is a wheelchair specifically designed for patients with hand and foot difficulties such as ALS. This wheelchair controls its own movement by collecting information from patients' eyeballs, thereby solving the problem of difficult travel for patients. At the same time, the wheelchair uses LiDAR to collect surrounding environmental information, and uses differential algorithms to estimate the position of the wheelchair, thereby achieving automatic driving of the wheelchair indoors.

Main functions:<br>
(1) Eye controlled movement: It can collect information from the eyeballs to control the movement of the wheelchair.<br>
(2) Indoor autonomous driving: Using LiDAR to achieve autonomous driving indoors.<br>
(3) Voice and music listening: For patients who are unable to speak, they can use their eyes to control the wheelchair and send customized voice messages, such as "I want to eat" and "I want to drink water". At the same time, patients can choose the songs to play by moving their eyes.

### My job responsibilities:<br>
(1) 2022-2023 Project Leader. <br>
(2) Upgrade of third-generation wheelchairs: Added autonomous driving algorithm. <br>
(3) Maintain the code for the project. Change the C # code to Python code and deploy it on the Ubuntu 22.04 system.
(4) Responsible for developing technical roadmap.

## Robomaster

(Competition Background:The RoboMaster National College Robot Competition is the most influential robot project in China, organized by Dajiang Innovation Technology Co., Ltd. It is a globally unique robot competition platform that includes various contents such as robot competitions, robot ecology, and engineering culture, [Website](https://www.robomaster.com/zh-CN).)

In the competition, I served as the deputy leader of the drone team (responsible for visual algorithms) and project management. All robots are assembled from scratch, and the following is a demonstration of our achievements:

### My job responsibilities:<br>
(1) Responsible for the visual recognition algorithm of drone robots towards the ground and the overall technical roadmap development of drones. Including but not limited to: object detection, multi-sensor fusion positioning, communication between electronic control and visual algorithms.<br>
(2) Responsible for project management of the entire team, including but not limited to: season planning, mid-term assessment, task planning, etc.
