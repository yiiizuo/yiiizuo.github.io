## Eye-controlled Intelligent Wheelchair
<img src="/images/Eye-Wheelchair.png">
This is a wheelchair specifically designed for patients with hand and foot difficulties such as frostbite. This wheelchair controls the movement of the wheelchair by collecting information from patients' eyeballs, solving the problem of difficult travel for patients. At the same time, the wheelchair uses LiDAR to collect surrounding environmental information, and uses differential algorithms to estimate the position of the wheelchair, thereby achieving automatic driving of the wheelchair.

Main functions:<br>
(1) Eye controlled movement: It is possible to use only the eyes to control the movement of the wheelchair.<br>
(2) Indoor autonomous driving: It can be carried out indoors.<br>
(3) Voice and music listening: For patients who do not need to speak, customized voice messages can be sent out through the eyes, such as "I want to eat" and "I want to drink water". At the same time, patients can choose the songs to play by moving their eyes.

## CareNurse in SenseTime

The intelligent nursing system is a nursing product designed for disabled patients such as those with progressive frostbite. It provides contactless care and monitoring of patients, measures their physiological indicators in real-time, and gives an alarm in certain situations. It also meets the needs of remote care by caregivers.
The intelligent nursing system is composed of CareNurse nursing software, SenseHealth display software, multiple alarms, and a vertical bracket.

Main functions:<br>
(1) Physiological indicators detection: non-contact real-time detection of the caregiver's heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature.<br>
(2) Abnormality detection: When the caregiver experiences breathing difficulties or other conditions, it will automatically alarm.<br>
(3) Actively calling for help: The caregiver can actively issue an alarm through facial expressions.<br>
(4) Remote monitoring: It is possible to remotely view the physiological indicators of the caregiver in real-time through the Pad.<br>


## Robomaster

(Competition Background:The RoboMaster National College Robot Competition is the most influential robot project in China, organized by Dajiang Innovation Technology Co., Ltd. It is a globally unique robot competition platform that includes various contents such as robot competitions, robot ecology, and engineering culture.
